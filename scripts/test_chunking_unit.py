This comprehensive lifecycle assessment covers the complete carbon footprint of
steel manufacturing using blast furnace technology. The analysis encompasses all
stages from raw material extraction to final product delivery.

Scope 1 Emissions: Direct emissions from the blast furnace include combustion of
coke and coal, resulting in approximately 1,850 kg CO2e per tonne of crude steel.
The reduction of iron ore in the blast furnace releases significant CO2 as the
carbon from coke reacts with oxygen in the ore. Additional emissions come from
limestone decomposition in the slagging process.

Scope 2 Emissions: Electricity consumption for auxiliary equipment, rolling mills,
and finishing operations contributes another 350-450 kg CO2e per tonne, depending
on the local grid carbon intensity. In regions with coal-heavy grids like China
and India, this figure can exceed 600 kg CO2e per tonne.

Scope 3 Emissions: Upstream emissions from iron ore mining, coal extraction, and
transportation add approximately 300-400 kg CO2e per tonne. Downstream emissions
from product distribution and end-of-life considerations vary by application and
geography.

Regional Variations: Carbon intensity varies significantly by region. European
steel production averages 1,800 kg CO2e per tonne due to higher efficiency and
lower carbon grids. Chinese production averages 2,100 kg CO2e per tonne. Japanese
production achieves approximately 1,700 kg CO2e through advanced technologies.

Regulatory Context: The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) covers steel production,
with free allocation declining to drive decarbonization. Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanisms (CBAM) will equalize costs between EU and imported steel from 2026.
California's Cap-and-Trade program and China's national ETS also regulate emissions.

Mitigation Strategies: Blast furnace efficiency improvements can reduce emissions
by 5-10%. Increased scrap steel use in electric arc furnaces cuts embodied carbon
by up to 75%. Hydrogen direct reduced iron (H-DRI) technology promises near-zero
emissions but requires massive renewable electricity deployment.

Technology Readiness: Current best available technology (BAT) achieves 1,650 kg
CO2e per tonne. Pilot projects for hydrogen-based steelmaking are operational in
Sweden and Germany, targeting commercial scale by 2030-2035.

Economic Considerations: Carbon prices of $50-100 per tonne CO2e make low-carbon
steel competitive in some markets. Government subsidies and procurement requirements
accelerate adoption in Europe, Japan, and California.
